Step-by-Step Guide to Drill-Down in IBM Cognos

	1.	Open IBM Cognos Analytics:
	•	Launch IBM Cognos Analytics and log in with your credentials.
	2.	Create or Open a Report:
	•	Navigate to the Reports section.
	•	Either create a new report or open an existing one where you want to implement the drill-down functionality.
	3.	Design the Initial Report:
	•	In the report designer, add the necessary data items (e.g., Product Number, Date, Revenue, Planned Revenue).
	•	Configure the report layout as needed, ensuring it includes tables or charts that will benefit from drill-down capabilities.
	4.	Add Drill-Down Functionality:
	•	Select Data Item: Click on the data item (e.g., Revenue) that will act as the drill-down trigger.
	•	Set Drill-Through Definition: In the properties pane, find the “Drill-through” option and set the target report or page.
	•	Configure Parameters: Specify the parameters that will be passed to the target report. These parameters often include the context (e.g., Product Number, Date) to ensure the drill-down provides relevant details.
	5.	Create the Target Report:
	•	If not already created, design the target report that will display detailed information when a drill-down is performed.
	•	Ensure the target report can accept the parameters from the initial report and filter data accordingly.
	6.	Test the Drill-Down:
	•	Run the initial report and perform a drill-down by clicking on the specified data item.
	•	Verify that the target report opens and displays the correct detailed information based on the selected context.
	7.	Refine and Customize:
	•	Adjust the design and layout of both the initial and target reports based on user feedback and testing results.
	•	Add any additional visualizations or filters to enhance the usability and effectiveness of the drill-down feature.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement drill-down functionality in your IBM Cognos Analytics reports, providing users with an interactive and detailed data exploration experience ￼.
